            <h1> 05/10/24 Phase 4 Retrospective</h1>
            <p>Working on the partner project for phase 4 has really opened my eyes to the depth and importance of the fronend and backend. I was even looking back at my phase 2 + other react projects and it was crazy to see that it didn't have a backend! Feeling very grateful to be in the position that I'm in and im looking forward to working on the phase 5 project : D. Moving forward i definitly need to put more emphasis on the importance / sensitivity of the backend. As someone with a visual deisgner background it's very easy for me to get caught up with the bells and whistle of website / product. But building something like a forum requires a lot of attention to detail in the backend so it was an experience that was extremely crucial.</p>

            <h1> 03/27/24 Phase 2 Retrospective</h1>
            <p>I have to be honest, as I said in my last post i'm coming to terms with thhe fact that I may not be a good programmer but i'm a programmer none the less. As I went back to study for my assesment I was watching a bunch of videos, and taking extra courses and I realized that the things that held me back in math are holding me back with programming. The logic it takes to work with code is very similar to the logic of an algebra, trigonometry, geometry and etc. And I failed all of those classes in High school, but it's only because I never gave it a fair effort. I usually lean into fields where I have an advantage and I'm realizing that I have to put in the work of expanding my logic to get better. I'm not going to be the best programmer but I can be a good one. I'm going to keep pushing forward and I'm going to keep learning. I started a book called "the mind for numbers" which goes hand in hand with a coursera course that teaches you how to learn. But the book specifically is meant to help people understand complex math logic. So as i'm wrapping up the second phase as an honestly below average react progammer, I'm looking forward to more learning opportunities, and just simply having the time to grow.</p>

            <h1> 03/21/24 Phase 2 + REACT</h1>
            <p>So learning REACT in phase 2 had a bit of a learning curve but as we're entering project week, I'm feeling more confident. I've just been going through the labs and trying to make sure I'm caught up on everything, but I'm feeling excited. As time goes on I see the changes in myself as a programmer and even though I'll admit i'm a pretty bad programmer at the moment... a year ago I couldn't even call myself a programmer to begin with so for that I'm grateful. I waited on working on personal projects this time around and focused on the labs so I'm looking forward to bringing my new skills into my new projects</p>

            <h1>02/21/24 Sora + Open A.I</h1>
            <p>I'm a big fan of innovation and using ai as a tool to help fuel creativity. I saw Sora by open.ai was announced and I'm a big fan of everything they put out. I've made album covers in Dall-e, solved many problems in chatGPT and I'm looking forward to creating videos with Sora. It's stll in a private beta but I think it's gonna help a lot of folks w/o resources help get their ideas out. Also Sora is sky in Japanese. Very symbolic for the heights that are being reached.</p>

            <h1>02/20/24 $100 Music Videos + Websites</h1>
            <p>I was walking through the neighborhood yesterday and I saw an amazing poster that caught my attention. It was for artists, creative agencies, or friendly people who needed help with their taxes. That inspired me to make this. I've been making music videos for cheap as practice and I wanted to incorporate my new coding skills to the package </p>
