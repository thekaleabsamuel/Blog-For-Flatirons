            <h1> 03/21/24 Phase 2 + REACT</h1>
            <p>So learning REACT in phase 2 had a bit of a learning curve but as we're entering project week I'm feeling more confident. I've just been going through the labs and trying to make sure I'm caught up on everything. But I'm feeling excited. As time goes on I see the changes in myself as a programmer and even though I'll admit i'm a pretty bad programmer at the moment... a year ago I couldn't even call myself a programmer to begin with so for that I'm grateful. I waited on working on personal projects this time around and focused on the labs so I'm looking forward to bringing my new skills into my new projects</p>

            <h1>02/21/24 Sora + Open A.I</h1>
            <p>I'm a big fan of innovation and using ai as a tool to help fuel creativity. I saw Sora by open.ai was announced and I'm a big fan of everything they put out. I've made album covers in Dall-e, solved many problems in chatGPT and I'm looking forward to creating videos with Sora. It's stll in a private beta but I think it's gonna help a lot of folks w/o resources help get their ideas out. Also Sora is sky in Japanese. Very symbolic for the heights that are being reached.</p>

            <h1>02/20/24 $100 Music Videos + Websites</h1>
            <p>I was walking through the neighborhood yesterday and I saw an amazing poster that caught my attention. It was for artists, creative agencies, or friendly people who needed help with their taxes. That inspired me to make this. I've been making music videos for cheap as practice and I wanted to incorporate my new coding skills to the package </p>
